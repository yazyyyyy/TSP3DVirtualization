# TSP3DVirtualization

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge of finding the shortest yet
most efficient route for a person to take given a list of specific destinations.
This application intends to show the visualization of the nodes and the path in a three
dimensional space and allows the user to perform certain operations on the paths and
see the distance change between the nodes. The application integrates the concepts of
computer graphics, Open GL API, C/C++ Programming with the simple 2-opt
algorithm of TSP to visualize the various operations available on graph.<br><br>
